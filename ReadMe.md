# Project Title

CO-OPERATIVE HOUSING SOCIETY BILLING SYSTEM.

## What's the project all about!!
The idea of the project was to create a very simple, light-weight system to manage the tedious task of monthly maintenance payments in a typical Co-operating housing society (CHS).
There are so many solutions out there which provide high-end support and provide a complete package for large CHS.
The idea was to provide a low cost solution for small to medium CHS where in only monthly billing is required.
The project takes in check payments from the members of CHS and processes bills at the end of the month.
It also imposes penalties at the end of the month for the defaulters.


### Technologies used:

1. Tomcat / JBoss Server.
2. Java 7 or above.

The project was developed using JSP and Servlet at the backend and JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS at the front end.


### Installing

Database schema can be created in Oracle or MySQL.
The rest of the project can just be copied into local machine, convert the project to a .war file and run the file on tomcat server.
